## a blog


This project is a replacement for my Posterous blog now (Feb '13)
 that Posterous is scheduled to cease operation in April.

Export from Posterous is reformated with an XQuery script to an internal XML format using xquery/convert-posterous.xq.

Basic browsing os provided by the xquery/home.xq script, supporting faceted access by tag, month, sequential access and free text search.

Much remains to be.

The development is discussed in the blog itself
